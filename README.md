Professional global market news + financial data, packaged as an **AI Agent Skill** for Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, and any project-skill-aware runtime. Your agent calls the [FinNotes commercial API](https://platform.finnotes.com) directly — real-time news, macroeconomic data series, and analyst columns — while your `fnp_` API key stays in `~/.finnotes/credentials.env` (mode 0600) and never enters the chat or the model's context.

Total size: ~125 KB. Zero runtime dependencies — every script uses only the Python 3 standard library.

## Quick start

### 1. Install

Pick whichever fits your agent runtime:

```bash
# Claude Code (user-level skill folder)
git clone https://github.com/FinNotes-Intelligence/finnotes-news-and-data-skill ~/.claude/skills/finnotes-api

# Codex
git clone https://github.com/FinNotes-Intelligence/finnotes-news-and-data-skill ~/.codex/skills/finnotes-api

# OpenClaw
git clone https://github.com/FinNotes-Intelligence/finnotes-news-and-data-skill ~/.openclaw/skills/finnotes-api

# Project-level (any runtime that auto-loads project skills)
git clone https://github.com/FinNotes-Intelligence/finnotes-news-and-data-skill ./.agent/skills/finnotes-api
```

Or download the release tarball from the [Releases page](https://github.com/FinNotes-Intelligence/finnotes-news-and-data-skill/releases) and extract to the same path.

### 2. Mint an API key

Sign in at [platform.finnotes.com/api-keys](https://platform.finnotes.com/api-keys) and click **Create New Key**. In the one-time-secret modal, click **`Download Agent JSON`** to download the structured handoff file (`finnotes-agent-key-<name>.json`).

> [!NOTE]
> **FinNotes is in Beta — Pro is free for 6 months.** Every new account that signs up **before 2027-01-01** receives a complimentary 6-month Pro subscription, which includes the API quota this skill consumes. No payment required during the Beta window.
>
> When the Beta program ends, **existing unexpired Pro subscriptions remain valid through their original 6-month term** — your access is not retroactively shortened. Only new sign-ups after the cutoff date will be subject to the post-Beta pricing.

### 3. Hand the key off to your agent

Tell your agent the path to the downloaded JSON file. The skill's `create-api-key-guide.md` instructs it to run:

```bash
python scripts/store_finnotes_key.py --handoff "/path/to/finnotes-agent-key.json"
```

This writes:
- `~/.finnotes/credentials.env` (mode 0600) — the secret, never read into model context
- `~/.finnotes/profile.json` — non-secret metadata (plan, permissions, prefix)

After the agent confirms import, it'll ask you whether to delete the original downloaded JSON. Confirm to run:

```bash
python scripts/delete_finnotes_handoff.py --handoff "/path/to/finnotes-agent-key.json" --confirmed
```

The `~/.finnotes/` files persist; only the downloaded copy in Downloads/ goes away.

### 4. Make a request

The agent (not you) runs **`finnotes_news.py`** for the common news workflows:

```bash
python scripts/finnotes_news.py 1                          # today's summary
python scripts/finnotes_news.py full                       # every today's article in full
python scripts/finnotes_news.py 7                          # last 7 days summary
python scripts/finnotes_news.py date 2026-06-20            # specific-date summary
python scripts/finnotes_news.py detail mn_174              # one article by id
python scripts/finnotes_news.py detail market-news <slug>  # one article by type+slug
```

For non-news endpoints (data series, reports, account, etc.) it falls back to the generic helper:

```bash
python scripts/finnotes_request.py GET "/data-series/categories"
```

The key stays in `credentials.env`. The agent only sees the API response body — not the secret.

## Security model

- **`credentials.env` is mode 0600** and explicitly off-limits to the agent's reading tools (per `references/create-api-key-guide.md` line 1).
- **Atomic writes**: `store_finnotes_key.py` writes via temp file + rename to avoid partial-state on interrupt.
- **Two-step destructive ops**: `delete_finnotes_handoff.py` refuses to run without `--confirmed`, which the agent only passes after explicit user confirmation.
- **Handoff format validation**: import script checks `kind == "finnotes.agent_key_handoff"`, `version == 1`, `credential.type == "bearer"`, and `plaintext` starts with `fnp_` before writing anything.
- **Error-code classification**: `finnotes_request.py` maps HTTP status to actionable agent signals (`FINNOTES_KEY_REJECTED`, `FINNOTES_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`, `FINNOTES_POINTS_OR_BALANCE_PROBLEM`, etc.) so the agent routes to the right exception handler in `create-api-key-guide.md`.

## How it relates to the platform

| Component | Where it lives |
| --- | --- |
| The actual API | `https://api.finnotes.com/v1` (Bearer auth, point-based billing) |
| The developer console (mint keys, inspect usage) | `https://platform.finnotes.com/api-keys` |
| The live AI docs (canonical, this skill's `references/*` are snapshots) | `https://platform.finnotes.com/docs/for-ai/` |
| OpenAPI 3 schema | `https://finnotes.com/docs/api-platform-openapi.json` |

If a `references/*` file in this skill drifts from the live doc, the live doc wins. Each release tags a snapshot, but for the freshest copy, fetch the live URL.

## Versioning

This skill is at `v0.2.1` — naming alignment patch on top of the v0.2.0 protocol revamp. Expect breaking changes before `v1.0.0`. The platform API contract itself is stable; what may change here is script CLI shape, error-code naming, and skill-manifest schema.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contributing

Filing an issue is the lowest-friction signal — describe the symptom + your runtime + the exit code from `scripts/finnotes_request.py`. PRs welcome for:
- Additional `agents/*.yaml` manifests for other runtimes
- More fine-grained error classification in `finnotes_request.py`
- Cross-platform path handling fixes (Windows users especially)
